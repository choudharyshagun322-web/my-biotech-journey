# STAGE 6: Build 3 Strong Beginner Projects

A CV with practical, hands-on projects is far more impressive than a list of skills. These projects are designed to directly mirror the work done in labs at NICPR and ICMR, making you an incredibly attractive candidate for internships.

1.  **[Project 1: Microbiome Analysis using QIIME2 + LEfSe](./1_Project_Microbiome/README.md)**
    *   *Skill Shown:* End-to-end microbiome data analysis. Highly relevant for NICPR.

2.  **[Project 2: BLAST + Biopython Automation](./2_Project_Automation/README.md)**
    *   *Skill Shown:* Core bioinformatics scripting and automation.

3.  **[Project 3: RNA-Seq Pipeline (FASTQ → DEG → Pathway Analysis)](./3_Project_RNASeq/README.md)**
    *   *Skill Shown:* Cancer genomics and transcriptomics analysis.
