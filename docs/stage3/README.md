# STAGE 3: LEfSe — Identify Biomarkers

LEfSe stands for **Linear Discriminant Analysis Effect Size**. It is a statistical method used to find features (in this case, microbes) that are consistently different between biological groups.

💡 **Purpose:** It is used heavily in **ICMR labs** and other research institutes for biomarker discovery. It helps answer the question: "Which specific microbes are more abundant in the 'Case' group versus the 'Control' group?"

### Workflow

The typical workflow connects directly from your QIIME2 analysis:

1.  **QIIME2 Output:** Start with the abundance table and metadata generated by QIIME2.
2.  **Format Conversion:** Convert the QIIME2 data into the specific format required by LEfSe.
3.  **Run LEfSe:** Execute the LEfSe algorithm to identify differentially abundant microbes.
4.  **Visualize Results:** Generate an LDA score plot, which shows the microbes that are most characteristic of each group.

### Getting Started

Running LEfSe can be complex. The easiest way to start is by using a web-based implementation.

📚 **Galaxy Server:** The [Galaxy project](https://galaxyproject.org/) hosts a web-based version of LEfSe that is easy to use for beginners. You can upload your formatted data and run the analysis through a graphical interface.
