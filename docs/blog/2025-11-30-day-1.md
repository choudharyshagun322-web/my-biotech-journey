# Day 1: My First Blog Post!

**Date:** 2025-11-30

Today, I learned how to set up this blogging section on my bioinformatics journey website!

Here are the key things I did:

*   Created a new `blog` directory inside the `docs` folder.
*   Added a new markdown file for my first post.
*   Updated the `mkdocs.yml` file to include a "Daily Blogging" section in the navigation bar.

This is a great way for me to keep track of my progress and document what I'm learning each day. I'm excited to continue this journey!
