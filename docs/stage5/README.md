# STAGE 5: Explore Tools Used in ICMR/NICPR Labs

If you want to work in a top Indian research institute like **ICMR** or **NICPR**, it pays to know the specific tools they use. This list is based on their public workshops, research papers, and job requirements.

Learning these shows that you are already aligned with their research priorities.

### Most Commonly Used Tools:

1.  **QIIME 2:** For microbiome analysis (as covered in Stage 2). A very in-demand skill.
2.  **LEfSe:** For biomarker discovery in microbiome data (as covered in Stage 3).
3.  **R & Bioconductor:** The primary environment for statistical analysis, especially in cancer genomics. Packages like `DESeq2` and `edgeR` are run in R.
4.  **GATK:** The gold standard for variant calling in human genetics and cancer research (as covered in Stage 4).
5.  **SPAdes / MEGAHIT:** For *de novo* genome assembly (assembling a genome from scratch without a reference).
6.  **MEGA / IQ-TREE / FastTree:** For building phylogenetic trees (understanding evolutionary relationships).
7.  **Docker / Singularity:** For creating reproducible software environments. You already know Docker, which is a huge advantage. Singularity is a similar tool often used in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments.
8.  **HPC Clusters:** Most serious NGS analysis is not run on a laptop. You'll need to be comfortable working on a command-line-only Linux server (HPC cluster) and using a job scheduler like Slurm or SGE.

🎯 **Focus Area:** If you master **QIIME2, LEfSe, GATK, and the basics of R**, you can directly contribute to projects at NICPR, NIBMG, ICMR-IGIB, NCCS, NCBS, and top IITs.
