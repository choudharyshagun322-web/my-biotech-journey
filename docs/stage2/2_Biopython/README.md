# Biopython — Your First Bioinformatics Programming Skill

💡 **Purpose:** Automate biological data tasks using Python. Instead of manually downloading files or converting formats, you can write scripts to do it for you. This is where your CS background gives you a huge advantage.

### Core Tasks You Will Learn

*   **Parsing FASTA files:** Read sequence data from a file into your Python program.
*   **Reading FASTQ files:** Handle raw sequencing reads, including their quality scores.
*   **Running BLAST from Python:** Automate sequence searches without using the web interface.
*   **Translating DNA to Protein:** A classic bioinformatics exercise applying the central dogma.
*   **Fetching data from NCBI:** Programmatically download data from the largest biological database.

### Getting Started

1.  **Install Biopython:**
    ```bash
    pip install biopython
    ```
    *(Remember to use the pip from your virtual environment: `./venv/bin/pip install biopython`)*

2.  **Practice:**
    Work through 5-6 beginner scripts covering the tasks above. The official [Biopython Tutorial and Cookbook](http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html) is an excellent resource.
