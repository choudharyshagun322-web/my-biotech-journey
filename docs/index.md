# STAGE 1: Core Biological Foundations for Bioinformatics

Welcome to Stage 1! As a Computer Science student, you're great at thinking about systems, data structures, and algorithms. This stage reframes the essential biology you need into those terms.

Biology, at its core, is an information processing system. You're perfectly equipped to understand it from this perspective.

## What's Inside:

*   [Genomics Basics](./1_genomics_basics/README.md): Understand the fundamental "data types" of biology (DNA, RNA, Protein) and the core "algorithm" (Central Dogma) that governs them.
*   [Data Formats](./2_data_formats/README.md): Learn how biological data is stored in standard file formats. Think of these as the JSON or XML of bioinformatics.
*   [Microbiome Introduction](./3_microbiome_introduction/README.md): A primer on a specific, high-demand field (microbiome analysis) and the data it generates.

Let's get started. Dive into the subdirectories to begin.
