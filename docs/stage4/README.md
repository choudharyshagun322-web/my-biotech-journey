# STAGE 4: Learn Genomics & Transcriptomics Tools

These tools are essential for any research involving DNA (genomics) or gene expression (transcriptomics), particularly in areas like cancer research at NICPR/ICMR.

This stage is broken down into two key areas:

1.  **[Essential Genomics Tools](./1_Genomics_Tools/README.md):** The standard pipeline for processing raw DNA sequencing data to find genetic variants.
2.  **[Transcriptomics (RNA-Seq) Tools](./2_Transcriptomics_Tools/README.md):** The standard pipeline for analyzing gene expression data to see which genes are more or less active.
